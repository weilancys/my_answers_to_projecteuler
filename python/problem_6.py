The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1 squared + 2 squared + ... + 10 squared = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10) squared = 55 squared = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
